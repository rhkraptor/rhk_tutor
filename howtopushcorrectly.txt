#((Awesome! ?? Now that everything is set up, let's streamline your workflow for **pushing to GitHub and Hugging Face efficiently**.

---

### **?? Quick Commands for Pushing Code**
You have two remotes:
- `origin` ? GitHub
- `hf` ? Hugging Face

#### **1?? Push to GitHub Only**
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

#### **2?? Push to Hugging Face Only**
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push hf main
```

---

### **?? Automate Pushing to Both GitHub & Hugging Face at Once**
You can push to both at the same time using:
```powershell
git push --all
```
But **this only works if both remotes are synced**.  
To force push both in one command:
```powershell
git push origin main && git push hf main
```

---

### **?? Setup Automatic Mirroring**
If you want **every GitHub push to automatically sync with Hugging Face**, follow these steps:

1?? **Set GitHub as the default remote (origin)**
```powershell
git remote set-url --add --push origin git@github.com:rhkraptor/rhk_tutor.git
git remote set-url --add --push origin git@hf.co:spaces/rhkraptor/rhk_tutor.git
```
2?? **Now, every time you push to `origin`, it will also push to `hf` automatically**
```powershell
git push origin main
```
This will push **both to GitHub & Hugging Face in one go**! ??

---

### **?? How to Check Your Remotes**
Run:
```powershell
git remote -v
```
If it shows **both GitHub & Hugging Face** under `origin`, you’re all set!

Now you won’t have to push twice manually! Let me know if you want further optimizations. ????))
